# SQLite_python_project

This project demonstrates the use of SQLite with Python to perform various SQL operations on a dataset containing 8 different tables. The operations range from simple queries to more complex data analysis tasks.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Creating the Database:** A new SQLite database is created to store the 8 tables.
2. **Loading the Data:** The data for each table is loaded into the database.
3. **Executing SQL Queries:** A series of SQL queries are performed on the dataset to extract meaningful insights.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following:

- **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.
- **SQLite** installed.
- **Jupyter Notebook** (optional, but recommended for interactive execution).

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sqlite_python_project.git
   cd sqlite_python_project
Create the Database:

Ensure that your SQLite database is created and named according to your preference. By default, the code expects a database named veri_tabanlarÄ±_sql.db. If you choose a different name, modify the connection string at the beginning of the notebook or script:

python
Copy code
%sql sqlite:///your_database_name.db
Load the Data:

Load the 8 tables into the SQLite database. Make sure that the data files are in the same directory as your Python script or Jupyter Notebook.

Run the Queries:

Execute the SQL queries provided in the project to interact with the database and perform the desired operations.

SQL Queries Overview
The project includes a set of SQL queries that perform the following tasks:

1-Count the number of customer entities in the Orders table./n
2-Find the number of unique customers in the Orders table./n
3-Group customers by country and count how many are in each./n
4-Filter customers based on whether they are from Brazil or the USA./n
5-Group customers by country and city, then count them./n
6-Find addresses containing the word "da"./n
7-Identify customers living in Germany-Berlin./n
8-Filter customers in Canada whose names contain "in"./n
9-List products with prices between $40 and $90./n
10-Find product names, prices, and squares of the prices for items over $30./n
11-List the CategoryIDs in the Products table./n
12-Calculate the average price of products in the "Beverages" category./n
13-Find total earnings from customers living in the USA./n
14-Calculate the average product price per category./n
15-List employees by their total sales./n
16-Find the average prices of orders from Germany by category./n
17-Calculate average prices of orders from Germany and the USA by category./n
18-Find the average price of orders placed in June, July, and August./n
19-List the maximum quantities of customer orders for 1997./n
20-List employees with orders from 1997, sorted by the number of orders./n
Usage
Interactive Execution:

If using a Jupyter Notebook, you can run the provided SQL queries interactively. The queries are written with %sql magic commands, which allow direct interaction with the SQLite database.

Script Execution:

If running as a Python script, ensure that the necessary libraries (sqlite3, pandas, etc.) are imported, and the database connection is correctly established.
